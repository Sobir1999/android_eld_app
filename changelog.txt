v1.0.6 11/29/2017
- Fixed issue with sending multiple write commands to the ELD (ReqRecord, DelRecord etc)
there was a bug that would cause the API to block after 10 write request 
- Added capability to upload debug information to the IOSiXservers  - RequestDebugData
App should provide a capablity for the users to upload debug data to help with debugging
vehicle connectivity issues. Sample app shows usage

v1.0.7 11/29/2017
- Fixed issue with cached periodic records instantiation 

v1.0.8 11/29/2017
- Eliminated app update binary resource as it is now downloaded from the server dynamically as needed

v1.0.9 12/12/2017
- Added SetVin method to allow for a manual VIN
- Timing updates for LTE radio/BLE coexistence

v1.0.10
- Refactored deprecated download filename method for UpdateFirmware that was causing a file download exception for some
customers (any app that was built with SDK target version 24 or higher)
- Now FirmwareUpdate will abort on a disconnect
- In fimrware update fatal exception messages are passed to the callback for troubleshooting
- Added API version method so we can retrieve API version from app - String GetApiVersion()

v1.0.11
- On Samsung Tab E disconnect resulted in a subsequent reconnect call in the callback
Thanks to Zack for identifying that clearing writeNotification on disconnect prevents this 
so this release implements the change

v1.0.12
- Fixed PeriodicCachedRecord missing getUnixTime method
- Changed firmwware update url from https to http as some android phones were pausing downloads due to cert chain issues

v1.0.13
- Added firmwareVersion parameter to StartUpdate - allows app to request a specific version for firmware update
- Added ResetEld method - allows app to reset the ELD (will disconnect the session)

- Added ConnectToEld method to allow app to pass in a Bluetooth device object

v1.0.16 06/05/2018
- Now blank values (when data is not available) are initialized with -1 instead of 0 to allow for 
easier detection if failures

v1.0.17 10/16/2018
- Added EnableDTCData method to enable DTC processing. When a diagnostic code is detected api will invoke a
callback to notify the app of the dtc the data will be in the form of a Json string that can be decoded by the
client app. Please see the sample app for the callback sample and the javadoc documentation
- Added DisableWiFi method to shut off WiFi on the Eld

v1.0.21 12/18/2018
